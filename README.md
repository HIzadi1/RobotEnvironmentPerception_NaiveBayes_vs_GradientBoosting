# RobotEnvironmentPerception_NaiveBayes_vs_GradientBoosting
The aim of the project is to find out what kind of surface the robot is operating on using robot`s IMU time series data. Two main category of ML techniues will be explored to tackle the problem: 1) Naive Bayes based clasiffiers, 2) Gradien Boosting techniues. A %77 accuracy is acheived, improving this accuracy is not the main objective of this work, rather I'd like to explore the above mentioned methods on time series data of dynamical systems as two completely different approach. Bayes inference methods are widely used in estimation theory in one hand and the gradient booditing as a sophisticated ML approach will be explored.
